# Retro Gaming With the Game Boy Color in 2023
![FinishedProject](https://github.com/AndyDoering/Retro-2023/blob/main/Images/post/finishedbuild.png)

## Hello, and thanks for reading! 

This project represents a fun foray into modernizing a familiar retro hand held, the Gameboy Color (GBC). Why, you might ask? Mostly for nostalgic reasons. I grew up playing on the GBC, so the opportunity to rediscover a piece of my childhood inspired me. I enjoy figuring out how things work, and this seemed like a fun challenge.

Further, there's a whole lot you can do with these little retro devices these days. Specifically, I planned to:

1. Download and digitize my own game cartridge collection
1. Utilize a custom game cartridge called an [Everdrive-GB X7](https://krikzz.com/our-products/cartridges/edgbx7.html), by Kirkzz, which makes it possible to load a collection of ROMs (`.gb` and `.gbc` in this case) and play them on the GBC hand held using only a single cartridge.
    - I opted for the `X7` for the real time clock support and high-quality recommendations from the community.
1. Download and play community made homebrew games like those found on [Itch.io](https://itch.io/c/1195395/game-boy-color-games)
1. Modify and play community-content patched variants of popular games, such as [Pokemon Unbound](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=382178) which is one of the most well known examples.
1. Design, create, and publish my own games, box art, and original sound tracks (OST)

## This write-up is presented in two parts (the second of which I am currently in the process of completing):

1. `Background - Modifying the Console - ROM Libraries and Homebrew Intro`

    The first section of this write-up details out a walkthrough of installing modern upgrades to the Game Boy Color, as well as tips for easier installs of the kits. This section also contains a quick background on game emulation, ROMs, creating ROM libraries, community made games, and hardware modifications. 

2. `Designing - Building - Packaging - Distributing a Game Boy Game`

    The second section of this write-up covers the technical aspects of designing and building video games on the Game Boy Color platform at present day. I will be analyzing all the technical requirements while learning to make games, as well as looking at the various options and creative tools available to make games playable in the web browser and GBC. I'll also cover the process for creating my own packaging, box and label art, and file production for sharing the game with the rest of the community.

## Kudos and Thanks:
We stand on the shoulders of giants, and this writeup is made possible through the work of passionate open-source folks, independent makers, and talented enthusiasts. I've provided links to the sites I purchased from, people I learned from, and tools I used while doing this project. Please consider supporting these folks who make doing projects like this possible!
